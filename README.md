# Sheepo
Sheepo Discord Bot Source Code.
Sheepo is a discord bot written in javascript, with integrated node.js/discord.js

Developed by Alok and Aryun Gupta, exclusively for the MrSuicideSheep Discord server!

No templates or so were used in making the bot, everything was done from scratch.
Integrated Tenor API for gif features.
Sheepo is a fully functional Moderation Bot with easter eggs and
fun commands for members too!

Our bot was hosted on Heroku. (deprecated)
